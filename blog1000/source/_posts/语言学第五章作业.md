### 1. Define the following terms

- syntax
```txt
In linguistics, syntax  is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of sentences in a given language, usually including word order. The term syntax is also used to refer to the study of such principles and processes.[3] The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the syntactic rules common to all languages.In mathematics, syntax refers to the rules governing the behavior of mathematical systems, such as formal languages used in logic.
```
- recursiveness
```txt
Recursion occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.

The property of being recursive; = recursivity.
Origin
1930s; earliest use found in American Journal of Mathematics. From recursive + -ness.

- surbordination
```txt
In linguistics, subordination (abbreviated variously subord, sbrd, subr or sr) is a principle of the hierarchical organization of linguistic units. While the principle is applicable in semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology, most work in linguistics employs the term "subordination" in the context of syntax, and that is the context in which it is considered here. The syntactic units of sentences are often either subordinate or coordinate to each other. Hence an understanding of subordination is promoted by an understanding of coordination, and vice versa.

- What are endocentric constructions and exocentric constructions?
```txt
An endocentric construction is one whose distribution is functionally equivalent or approaching equivalence to that of one or more of its constituents i. e. a word or a group of words which serves as a definable center or head. Hence an endocentric construction is also known as a headed construction. Noun phrases like Lovely Lucy are typical endocentric constructions. Opposite of endocentric constructions the exocentric construction refers to a group of syntactically related words where none of the words is functionally equivalent to the group as a whole. There is no noticeable centre or head in it. Prepositional phrases like " on the shelf" are typical examples of this type.
